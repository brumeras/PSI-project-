5th group's students of VU project. Members: Roberta Tamaševskytė, Emilija Sankauskaitė, Kamilė Maleiškaitė, Rokas Kancius, Ugnė Jurkšaitytė.


## 🎯 Project Idea

🪢 KNOTS is an interactive icebreaker game designed to bring people closer together. 

- Split players into groups.  
- Each player answers **5 questions** (configurable).  
- When everyone finishes, all group members **vote** (like/dislike) on each answer.  
- Based on the votes, the system generates a **matching table** showing compatibility between players.  
- The matches help spark conversations and create opportunities for real-life connections.
